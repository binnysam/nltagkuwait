    excerpt:
      "Praise be to God! Three times, while lying on the edge of death, the Lord compelled me to rise and share my testimony...",
    content: `Praise be to God! Three times, while lying on the edge of death, the Lord compelled me to rise and share my testimony with the world.
I prayed and asked God, "How can I share it, Lord?"

Where there is unity and love, there will be no lack, for God Himself moves in that place. His wonders unfold when His people stand together in faith.
With the prayerful support of my children and our church family, I began sharing my living testimony — a story of God’s power, healing, and faithfulness.

My heart’s desire is that everyone who listens to these testimonies will be strengthened to live boldly for the name of Christ, never ashamed of the Gospel.
The purpose of this series is not only to tell my story but to lead many to salvation, for the coming of our Lord is near.

As Scripture says:
“Do not be ashamed of the testimony about our Lord.” — 2 Timothy 1:8`,
